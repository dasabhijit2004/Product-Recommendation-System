review,rating,sentiment
i have to admit that i was skeptical about seeing this movie at the theater. however after renting the movie i knew i had made a mistake. this is a very funny movie and i just had to own it so i bought it at best buy. you won't regret buying it too!,5,1.0
"i use to love clear... until it changed it's formula. sadly, the scent is horrible is nothing like the original. i don't know why clear is not taking the feedback from its consumers - over 50 comments from people who have taken the time to write to you about a product they once loved. i know the average rating was above 4.8 stars... now it is at 2.9. clear- please listen to your customers! we hate this product and want the original back. until then... guess i will use something else. :(",1,0.0

"i generally love aveeno products but this one falls short. babies and toddlers are active, and they rub their eyes, and they cry. this sunscreen, if it gets into their eyes, will have you feeling like the worst parent in the world. my baby girl looked like she was in so much pain when she rubbed her face after i applied sunscreen. she looked so bad that it actually caused an argument with my husband on how i was so terrible at sunscreen application (how could i not be more careful to not get it in her eyes!).",2,0.0

"i had been using exxtra gel for years, until you decided to change the formula. it took me most of my life to finally find a gel that truly worked in my hair. at first i thought it was just the packaging, but the first time i had to buy a new bottle (i was using one every two weeks, as i have very long hair) i was appalled at the smell. it only got worse when i actually tried to use it in my hair. it is thin and sticky and not at all the same. and it seems i am not the only one that is extremely dissatisfied. bring it back!!!!",1,0.0

"i'm biracial (black and white) and every biracial person's hair is slightly different from the next biracial person's. unlike a lot of black and and white biracial people i know, i can't use products like carol's daughter and mixed chicks. for years, literally years, i searched high and low and low for a product that would tame my mane. i finally found the exxte gel and it was like the hair gods smiled on me. perfect is an understatement. it kept my normally super frizzy, over-the-top-puffy hair tame, smooth, shinny, and appropriately volumized. additionally, i could get two or three days worth of style put of one application which was amazing because before the exxtra gel, i'd spend a crazy amount of time wrestling my hair into a tight bun. but that was before the formula change. what happened. now the gel feels more alcohol or water based. i have to use three times as much. it flakes. i have to rinse it out everyday. it smells weird. it leaves weird dry, frizzy patches. in no way are blow dryers welcome with this new formula. i don't know why nexxus ruined a wonderful thing that didn't need to be fixed. please bring back the last formula. p.s. the new branding is beautiful. the sort of rose gold color is really nice....but the formula has to be reverted.",1,1.0

"i got this box set as a gift for my significant other and i think we both enjoy it equally. if you are a resident evil fan, this is a must have! it has all 5 movies on blu-ray and each disc has a ton of special features. buying these movies individually would be more expensive and you wouldn't have a sweet box to put them in!i've seen all the resident evil movies and in my opinion, they are fantastic. zombie action movies might not be for everyone, but they are for me! alice is a badass and the action sequences are really awesome. if you like horror, action, and zombies, these movies will be right up your alley.",5,1.0

"i've tried many products to control my hair and many are just terrible... either too greasy, too shiny, too thick or too much fragrance or some combination of these. i had the opportunity to try this baxter of california cream pomade and this may be one hair product that i'll actually use again.it's a very lightweight cream with a consistency similar to a hand cream. previously i had been using menscience hair styling pomade (2 oz.) and it is very hard in the container... nearly like hardened wax. it's somewhat of a chore to use it because you literally have to scoop out a dab of it and let it warm up in your hands before you can put it into your hair.this pomade is very creamy and infinitely easier to scoop out and apply than the menscience pomade. although the baxter of california pomade is not fragrance free, the amount of fragrance is very minimal and barely discernible.it's a lightweight holding power that lets my curls curl and at the same time leaves my hair soft. it may not provide enough hold for some hair types but for my hair, it works great.",5,1.0

"i'm a hardcore brand buyer, all of my cosmetics and other beauty products are high end, but i've heard so many good things about airspun powder that i had to try it. it's amazing! this is the first setting powder that i've found that is lightweight, doesn't crease, settle into fine lines, get blotchy or cakey, and that i can use to touch up my makeup after sweating and producing oil all day. the first time i used it i'd been out all day shopping in 90 weather, so i was an oily, sweaty mess and after using a little of this all of the oil and sweat was gone, and my makeup looked better than when i'd first applied it 8 hours prior. it has a strong scent that i wasn't expecting, but that's hardly an issue. the only reason i rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i feel like it could get cakey and heavy quickly if you were to go too crazy with it. but other than that this is the best setting powder i've found and it blows my mind how well it works because it is a drug store product and i normally steer clear of those altogether.",4,1.0

"the axe phoenix deodorant stick, is a non-spray deodorant, its got a nice smell, which reminds me of my old campgrounds i used to visit a lot in my younger days, and it makes my wife happy with the smell as well, (truth be told, my sense of smell is usually out of wack, considering i tend to get stuffy noses a lot), but this one's product manages to be noticed by my plugged nose, and its an aroma that both me and my wife enjoys, so i'm happy wiht the product. now for you customers who are curious about this deodorant, it'll work, just remeber that since it is a stick, not a spray, you got take off the cap, and roll it on, now it'll last awhile, usually around most of the day, as long as you're not sweating the whole day through, and it doesn't stain black clothing as well this review was collected as part of a promotion.",5,1.0

"i have been using exxtra gel for as long as i can remember. i usually buy it in bulk so i've had the old formula for a while. not sure when it changed, i thought it was just new packaging... but i am so disappointed. i just used the new formula for the first time. the consistency is thinner, the smell is offensive to me... i am tempted to go wash it out, it's so bad. it almost smells like hair products made for men with a musky scent. why did you change it i definitely don't think the change was for the better. the old formula was the only gel that worked for me and i've been recommending it to people for years. i don't think i'll be buying this again, and it makes me sad. i feel like i'm breaking up with someone! my hair does not look the way it did with the old formula and the smell alone is enough to keep me away. i seriously might cry... exxtra gel was like a hair miracle. i could apply it to my slept on, unruly, frizzy head of curls and it made my curls look fresh again. my husband literally has commented on the before and after of the old formula, amazed at how shiny and defined my crazy bed head looked after just a dime sized amount. i had to apply a lot more of the new formula, as it is much less concentrated, to get my hair to look acceptable. why, why, why i see from other reviews that i am not the only unhappy customer...please bring back the old formula.",1,0.0

"it's a tour de force for olivia de havilland as she plays catherine sloper, the mousey, nave daughter of a wealthy doctor (ralph richardson) in 19th century new york. catherine has grown up with her father telling her how clumsy and unattractive she is compared to her late mother, so when a dashing, though penniless, young man (montgomery clift) comes to call, she falls head over heels. big mistake.de havilland rightly won best actress of 1950, for her stunning portrayal of the meek and frightened girl who, older and wiser, becomes a steely and confident woman. everything about her changes in the transformation, from her posture to her voice, and above all, her inner bearing. she's unforgettable. richardson is also superb as the cruel father and clift is perfectly cast as the oily suitor.the magnificent gowns and detailed sets capture the period beautifully and the literate script overflows with memorable lines about harm done in the name of love. this is a stunning movie that can be enjoyed again and again.",5,1.0

"when i heard of planes: fire & rescue, i couldn?? imagine the sequel being better than the original. however, after having seen the movie i can admit i was wrong. planes: fire & rescue is a superior movie to planes in every way. it?? a movie that people of any age can enjoy watching and honors the nations firefighters at the same time.in terms of story, the film follows the hero of planes, dusty crophopper (voice by dane cook). after winning the wings across the world race, dusty has now become a world famous celebrity and made a very successful career out of racing. he has become one of the best racers in the world. however, a personal ??edical??tragedy as well as an economic crisis at propwash junction force dusty to re-evaluate his life. in order to help the airport (and get some perspective away from racing), dusty volunteers to become trained and certified as a firefighter. he?? sent away to a training center in piston peak. while there he becomes engulfed in fighting a massive wildfire and, along the way, learns some very important life lessons.",5,1.0

"first, a disclaimer of sorts . im a long-term, died-in-the-wool hoover evangelist. no, i dont work for hoover, but ive used hoovers religiously for 30 years. ive tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but always returned to hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability.that does not, however, mean they were perfect. the hoover windtunnel u6439 bagged upright that ive had for the last several years would suck up a buick. unfortunately, it also rivaled a buick in the weight category. although its supposedly a self-propelled model, i felt like i had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. it became something i would put off because i wasnt sure i had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house. the windtunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them. the hepa filter on my old windtunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. after that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as i vacuumed, even after i cleaned/replaced the filters. lastly, noise of my previous windtunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.when i saw a tv commercial for the hoover platinum series machines, i was definitely intrigued. i loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, hoover). but i was skeptical; could the power of a hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds? id tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best.i made a beeline for the internet to start researching. over a couple of days of intensive reading, i decided to continue my trust in hoover and took the plunge.both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when i got home from work. the first thing i noticed was that i could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a sumo wrestler that was promising. after removing everything, i was stunned at the weight  or lack thereof  for both machines.the physical appearance is very appealing; the upright is sleek and slim with a 35 long cord, and the canister has tools-on-board, along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can wear it while you vacuum. you will be stunned by how little these machines weigh  a child could easily lift them both. but could they clean?when i fired up the platinum upright, the word that kept coming out of my mouth was wow. first off, no more jets taking off in my living room  just a pleasing hum. second, this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term self-propelled. it seemingly floated over my carpeting all on its own, while still having the suck-up-a-buick power i expected from a hoover. it cleaned better in one pass than its older u6439 windtunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. i was picking up stuff i didnt even know was there. whether vacuuming underneath your bed, or behind that dresser that you havent moved since you moved in 15 years ago, it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.i have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that i had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks. the platinum upright made it look brand new. and hallelujah for a true edge cleaner! everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights, but this one truly delivers on the promise. think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers  like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor. this platinum upright sucked up all that debris  right to the edge.the maneuverability of the platinum upright is astonishing. it truly is as light as hoover claims and it moves as easily as a dyson. the upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease. it also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent, lighted, fingertip control right up there on the handle.the hepa filtration is light-years ahead of my previous windtunnel  think hepa with a hemi under the hood. yes, i know that bags are expensive, but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk. i dont mind paying for a product that truly works  these bags, and this new platinum hepa filtration system, truly work. no dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywhere.the platinum canister has a carrying strap, which makes so much sense. the folks who clean my office building uses strap-on canister vacuums and i always what an intelligent design  now, ive got my own. and all the tools are right there attached to the unit, ready and waiting for you. i toted that canister all over the house, cleaning window sills, ceiling corners, air conditioning vents, everything! then i walked into the garage and cleaned the inside of my suv. its quiet, powerful and incredibly portable  the best canister ive ever used.in my first test run of this hoover platinum vacuum system, i found myself looking for stuff to clean; i couldnt get enough of it. the hoover uh30010com platinum is, quite simply, the best vacuum period ive ever owned. i absolutely love this machine  and to get 2 vacuums  an upright and a canister  for the same price just makes terrific economic sense. it has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet, sleek, lightweight package that doesnt leave me feeling deaf, sore and exhausted. bravo, hoover!",5,1.0

"just bought one of these racks after first finding them on another site -- for more than twice the price! so glad i did a search on the product name and found it at wal-mart. anyway, the rack itself is 36 wide and comes with hooks to screw into your ceiling plus a dozen or so s-hooks so you can decide how low to hang it. (i didn't use any s-hooks as my kitchen has soffits, making the ceiling just 7' from the floor. even without any s-hooks, the pans hang fairly low, but since they are hanging over a peninsula and not in a kitchen aisle, it works out. just be aware of this is you have low ceilings in your kitchen.) the rack is a cinch to assemble and hang (took me less than 5 minutes), and comes with 6 hooks - 4 regular plus 2 swivel. the swivel hooks are especially useful for pans that have the hole in the wrong direction -- i.e., pans with holes that make the pans hang in the direction that takes up too much room (e.g., a frying pan that hangs from the front instead of from the side). the swivel hooks allow you to change the direction so again, they are very useful. after seeing the quality of the 1st rack i bought, i ordered 2 more -- 1 to put up parallel to the 1st and 1 to use just for the extra 6 hooks, since buying them individually from other places online (wal-mart doesn't seem to carry them) is ridiculously expensive. (some places sell 1 hook for the almost same price for which wal-mart sells the entire rack!) thanks, wal-mart, for a fantastic deal!!",5,1.0

"i love aveeno's lotions, shampoos, and body washes for adults, and i trusted their brand name, so i gave this sunblock a try for my toddler. before i put it on him, though, i tested it myself, and i am so glad i did. i used it on my face, and people, it stinks. it smells like you got a splash of gasoline on you at the gas station, and when it's rubbed into your face so that you can't get away from it -- ugh, nauseating! i understand that it is unscented, but the ingredients in it smell like gasoline to me. even after testing it, though, i was still willing to consider maybe using it for my boy, because again, i trusted aveeno, and i know that different lotions smell different to different people. but then, my husband used it before he mowed the lawn one day, and he came back to me, unsolicited, and said, and i quote, that stuff smells terrible! it smells like gasoline! i couldn't believe it. i had never asked him what he thought, or mentioned to him that that's exactly the same impression i had had! so that settled it: i tossed the barely-used tube into the trash. before you buy this product, try taking a whiff of it at your local grocery or drug store. if you can smell that gasoline smell at all, don't buy it, because the effect will be intensified once it's on your face (or your poor baby's face!).",1,0.0

"clambake starring elvis presley,shelley fabares,will hutchins,bill bixby,gary merrill,and james gregory was an entertaining film with a very good cast.it's a take-off on the prince and the pauper story of a rich man that swaps identity with a poor man and wants to see if he can be a success without the family wealth.too bad the quality of the print used in making this dvd was poor.the sharpness is disappointing, the color is weak, and there are numerous artifacts seen such as scratches and streaks.also,the soundtrack is mediocre at best,even though a true hifi/stereo soundtrack was originally recorded by elvis for this release.there is no excuse for this hatchet-job,and i recommend you avoid purchasing this title until a respectable effort is made to produce a high-quality copy of this film.if you are a die-hard elvis fan you'll probably buy it for your library,but the studio did justice to no one with the release of this dvd.shame on the greedy leeches!",3,1.0

"i'm not really that into this gloss. the color is really pretty (184 rose on and on) but the consistency is weird. its not thick, it's almost watery. it's kind of like a stain more so than a gloss but it doesnt really stain and stay on very long. the packaging is pretty but i would not buy it again just for that. i taste it when i'm wearing it which i dont like either. i think there are better glosses out there.",3,1.0

i love that it has that tingly feeling of the beeswax lip balm and the moisture still. the colors are great but the color never matches the cap...... thats the only thing i personally don't like at all. but other than that i love burt's bees lip shimmer!!!! there is a color there for everyone. i found one for my mom and she is super tuff on lipsticks. i was misleaded on the website. i thought the lip shimmers were wayyyyy bigger than they really were..... but it works so well that i think it's worth it. and come on it natural and not tested on animals.,4,1.0
"i have been using touch of gray (black-gray) for about 4 years now. applying about every 3-4 weeks keeps my hair looking the same throughout the year. this product is easy to use, and the results are the same after each use. i am very satisfied with the product and hope it remains available for many years to come.",5,1.0
i thought this shampoo was great it felt good in my hair it didn't dry my hair out or make it overly oily. however the smell was a little strong for me it did smell good just alittle strong that's my only dislike. however if smell really doesn't bother you then you'll love this shampoo. i was given this product to try and review by influencer. however my opinion of the product is my own.,4,1.0
"i love the convenience of these wipes. they are sturdy yet soft and stay moist when sealed properly, and they are able to clean and disinfect in tight spaces. whenever my family gets sick i go around the house wiping surfaces that are often touched, including remotes and door/faucet handles. i used to do this with lysol spray but found it much more convenient to just target the areas i need without accidentally spraying all over the place (including on my pets!). the fresh aroma is pretty average and i plan on trying the other scents in the future.",4,1.0

"the resident evil series doesn't require deep thought or reflection, but on balance it is better than it has a right to be, although the fifth installment was a bit too much like a videogame (i know the movies are based on a video game, but the last installment had a little too much of that feel to me). it's a great series of movies for exercise on a treadmill or spinner bike.",4,1.0

"this gel used to be great. they recently reformulated it and it is a very different product with the same name. at first, i figured they just updated the packaging, but as soon as i squirted some out, the difference was obvious. it looks different, smells different, and behaves very differently in your hair. honestly, they should have just said that they were discontinuing the product and came up with a new name for it. the ingredients are not the same. i don't know what they were thinking.personally, i have curly/wavy hair and i don't find that this stuff holds up throughout the day. especially on humid days, when my hair just looks poofy. i am currently trying to find a new hair gel that i like as much as the old version of this product. i will not be buying this product again, unfortunately.",1,1.0

i had a dyson for years and reviewed a lot of vacuums before deciding on this one. compared to the dyson it is so light weight and vacuums so easily. the only complaint is that it's not that great on my laminate wood. i have to go over it a couple of times. i wish it had a bare floor option so that the brush could be stopped while vacumming bare floors. it seems to do fine on my tile. and i do like the separate canister-it makes vacuuming stairs so much easier and i like it for quick clean ups and getting under furniture.,5,1.0

"i thought this movie was good, not necessarily great. it had plenty of good things going for it and it was much better than that horrible 1998 godzilla movie that butchered the franchise. this movie however, stays true to the original godzilla movie as well as the original franchise as a whole by keeping the plot close to how godzilla is a force of nature that reminds us that nature isn't in humanity's control. it also gives good, just short of great, action sequences of monster vs. monster action of older godzilla movies. the acting in this movie is really well done for a small number of actor's, especially bryan cranston performance, while most others where a little lacking or not very convincing of their characters. regardless, if you are a godzilla fan, like me, and haven't seen this movie already, then you will appreciate this film greatly. the only thing i thought was terrible about it was that the ""evil"" monsters in the film seemed a little too generic like the cloverfield monster. other than that, it is a film worth watching.",4,1.0

"the 2014 version of godzilla really surprised me. i was expecting a slapstick interpretation similar to the 1998 feature by devlin/emmerich. this version really took the mythology of the godzilla movie franchise and updated it with incredible cgi. my only complaint is changing the emphasis from a knowledgeable scientist and protagonist (bryan cranston) to his military son. finally, i wish the creature fights occurred during the day instead of using the cover of night for the cgi. overall, a great time at the movies.",4,1.0

"this is good for removing just a bit of leftover mascara or whatever else, not necessarily a full face of makeup. i found that when i tried to remove a full face of makeup, i had to use an excessive amount of product. this works best for eye makeup, specifically smaller amounts. i would suggest washing your face and using this to touch up afterwards. this product gently removes makeup and doesn't sting however, it leaves a bit of a greasy feel.",3,1.0

"oily hair girls, this is for you. the clay conditioner works great in combination with the clay shampoo and clay mask to truly balance and reset your oily hair. like i said in my other reviews, just remember that less is more. be mindful of your own hair and don't use this every day. this combination set is meant to cleanse your hair of excess oils so that you do not need to wash your hair every day. if you do try to use this every day, then it might strip your hair too much and make it dry. but if you follow the instructed use, this works great on non-color treated hair. i found that after using this, it stripped my color too quickly compared to other color treated shampoos. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",4,1.0

"came with a couple of cracked bricks but they sent new ones out within 3 days. i went through the break in heating and all was well until my first full fire. the paint started flaking off all over the top of it. it was reading 370 degrees with a digital thermometer. exhaust pipe was 310 so even with the vent fully closed as they say to do after it is fully heated.. most of the heat was escaping. not as efficient as they advertise.. it burns on low for a good 5 hrs at the most with a full load of dry seasoned wood. the glass gets dirty quick. its a decent built stove, but it already looks 10 yrs old within the first 3 weeks of operating it. needs to be cleaned a lot and kind of hard to do because you have to lift the brick out of the middle to put the ashes in the pan. decent stove, good heat, but a lot goes out the chimney. the blower is kind of noisy and really doesn't put out much air anyway...it would be great for a cabin or workshop. but as a center piece in your home, i would spend more money on a better quality one. ive had the catylic type before and it was a pain as well. my suggestion is when buying a stove, spend the money. you will only have to do it once and it will pay for itself. decent stove, if it were 200 cheaper i would say buy one of you don't mind a old looking black iron stove. it heats up my 1500 sq ft home. but i have to get up in the middle of the night to add wood and stoke it again. it will not burn for 8 to 10 hrs as advertised.. 5 at the most. you will have coals that are hot after 7 hrs. but that's it. and that is fully closed damper on the lowest setting. it goes about an hr or so on full on heat. kinda like a steam engine. you need to keep shoveling wood in it if you want full heat on a freezing day!!",2,1.0

"i received this product for free from influenster and love the clay hair mask and shampoo, but am quite unsure of my feelings towards this conditioner. it has a different consistency in comparison to other conditioners this one is runny whereas conditioners are typically a little thicker. i enjoyed this product because i use the entire system when i wash my hair, but i'm not sure if i see a difference with my oily scalp due to this conditioner. it's great for detangling though! after i wash the clay mask out of my hair and shampoo, i squeeze a dime sized amount of conditioner and apply it to my hair by running my hands from the crown of my scalp down to the ends. then i kind of use my fingers to comb it through so it mainly detangles rather than touches my roots. i will continue to use it though with this system and test to see if it really makes a difference because my leave in conditioner does the same. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",3,1.0

"i've ordered this and the black japonica from lundberg, and the wehani is the better of the two, hands down. the wehani has a very nice fragrance, not unlike that of jasmine rice. similar to the effect the smell of fresh popcorn has on many, the scent of wehani rice cooking simply makes you want some. to be clear, i'm not saying it smells like popcorn, but the effect... you get it.for those with rice cookers that spit, be aware that the spray coming off this rice will be reddish in color. probably won't permanently stain any of your hard kitchen surfaces, but you may want to keep white walls, towels, pets, etc. safely outside of the splash zone (lest, your lhaso apso, rover, be henceforth known as rusty).personally, i like rice/grain blends, and i combine the wehani with wild rice and pearled barley to mimic a rice select blend (can't remember which) i really loved. while i prefer the blend, the flavor and aroma of this rice by itself are excellent. get some.",5,1.0

"from all i have ever been able to learn, lundberg is a first class operation. i have tried (i think) every rice and rice blend that they offer, over the years that i have been buying their products. while i didn't always care for a particular variety, it was never an issue of quality, just a matter of personal preference.there is one problem, which is not lundberg's fault, but is worth noting. too often, in local grocery stores, the lundberg product does not turn over fast enough to avoid a decline in quality. i assume it is caused by a fermentation of the whole grain (not a problem with lesser rices because much of the good stuff is removed). the symptoms are a bag which is swollen, and rice which tastes a bit like play-doh smells. play-doh 24 pack of colors in order to avoid this problem, i started ordering my lundberg on-line, and storing the extra bags in my freezer or refrigerator until used. so, buying it here (which is a little cheaper than lundberg's on-line store) is a good way to go. if you want to buy just one bag to try at your local grocery store, check the bag carefully, and if it tastes like play-doh when you get home with it, that bag was too old.of all the lundberg products, countrywild is my absolute favorite. it is a nice blend of flavors, and i sometimes eat a bowl of it for my entire meal. it has a good flavor to it, but it is not as intense as some of the other varieties.one more thing. for years i was frustrated with obtaining a good result when cooking whole grain rice. i finally tried a pressure rice cooker instead of the more common non-pressure methods. it really made a huge difference, and if you are a rice lover, you may want to try something like this sanyo ecj-px50s 5-cup micro-computerized pressure rice cooker and steamer or if your budget can stand it, zojirushi np-htc18 induction heating 10-cup pressure rice cooker and warmer(i use the sanyo and like it pretty well. a search on pressure rice cooker here, or a visit to any large asian store, will reveal other makes and models, but there are no inexpensive pressure type rice cookers because of the substantial construction and safety requirements.)",5,1.0

"this is the fourth vacuum i've purchased in the last two months, and the first one i didn't return. i'm very pleased with the performance of both the upright and handheld with attachments. i feel hoover has come back to producing quality vacuums, and i hope i will be able to say this 6 months down the road. i have 2 terriers that shed constantly, and both vacuums pick up the dog hair quite well. the upright is streamlined and not heavy to pick up--and i'm not a very strong woman. some reviewers have complained of the noise of the handheld, but i don't think it's inordinately loud. yes, i would like it to be quieter, but it's average in my opinion. all in all, i'm thrilled with this vacuum pair and expect them to last for many years. one warning though, this upright is not for shag carpet! i have a shag area rug, and it is very hard to push and pull the vacuum over it. i must switch it to the low setting and lower the handle as much as possible to lessen the suction. since i have only this one rug, i still love this vacuum for my regular carpetting, tile and laminate floors. unless your house is mostly shag carpet, i would recommend this vacuum.",5,1.0

"i was very excited when influenster sent me this product to try (free of charge). i tried it as part of a 3-step system that includes the shampoo and conditioner and i have to say that it seemed to work for my hair. i went from shampooing my hair every other day, to doing it only twice a week. the first time i used the system my hair did not get oily until the end of the 3rd day, which was amazing, but as i used it, i saw that my hair got used to it and my hair started getting oily by the 2nd day. this conditioner was incredibly moisturizing to the point that i thought i was putting a mask on my hair (and not to mention how great it smells!) overall, i do recommend you try it if you have dry ends and very oily roots. i know how frustrating it is (and not to mention damaging!) to have to wash you hair every day or every other day. give it a try. disclaimer: i received this product free of charge and all my opinions are my own without bias. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",4,1.0

limited uses. product is not good if using multiple full size sheets of paper. would be good for receipts and things like that. good that small things won't fall through the bottom of the folder. folder sections don't expand with the rest of the file folder for thicker files. the major flaw is how thin the file folder is. i use file folders to protect other papers - i want something that will hold up to a lot of handling and tossing on the car seat or on the desk. i don't want something that looks and feels like paper - i want something stronger.,2,1.0

i have been buying australian gold since around 1990 i believe. it's been so long i can't remember when i started buying it. it is the only lotion i will buy. i bought another kind way back when and i broke out in a rash and my face swelled up. since using australian gold this has never happened. it keeps my skin moist and soft and i never feel dried out after being in the sun. i am a sun worshipper so i need to have some protection. i do not burn easy and find i like the 4 the best as i get a beautiful tan without burning. when out with my friends they are always using my lotion. also i love the smell of the lotion. everyone says i smell like a pina colada. i usually have on hand at least two or three and have a bottle in every beach bag. this review was collected as part of a promotion.,5,1.0

"i just read some reviews about the handle breaking on these vacuums and i wonder if people are lifting their vacuum and carrying it around incorrectly. there is a carry handle on the vacuum and it should only be lifted with that. i always lift my hoover via its carry handle, not the handle used when operating the machine, and after owning this hoover for several years now i have to say it has never given me any grief. it is lightweight and easy to use and the only thing i have to do occasionally is adjust the bag when the red warning light comes on notifying me that the bag is full when in reality, it isn't. sometimes this happens within a couple days of installing a new bag so i know it cannot possibly need changing. i figured out what was happening and it is cat hair clogging the upper part of the bag. if i have a lot of cat hair to clean up this can happen because the hair does not fall to the bottom of the bag like normal weight debris will...instead, it gets sucked into the bag and stays right there at the top and after a few days of that happening, the change bag warning light comes on because the cat hair stuck at the top of the bag makes the machine think the bag is full. the little canister cleaner is not quite as wonderful as the upright--it's actually quite basic--but it comes in handy for cleaning out the car.",5,1.0

"my hair is naturally straight but with quite a bit of frizz which gets worse during summertime on the east coast because of the humidity. plus, with the color treatment that i regularly let my hair suffer from, frizz has always been an issue for me. of course there are ways to control it, such as by using oils, treatment cream, and even hair spray none of which i'm all that crazy about as often times they irritate my skin as they are applied after a wash and remain on the hair for the rest of the day. then came the suave sleek series.. not only the consistency of the product feel expensive, the first time i used the shampoo, i didn't even feel the need to use the conditioner as it already felt so smooth. the scent is great, and they really do help with the frizz, a lot. i don't even brush my hair anymore because it feels so great. no tangles, just straight, soft, smooth hair. really worth trying especially considering the price! can't beat that. highly recommended! this review was collected as part of a promotion.",5,1.0

"i'm sooo totally in love with this lip shimmer! i bought it at my local cracker barrel in plum just fell in love with it! i also wanna get it in guava, peony, raisin pretty much all of the colors. i have a pale, olive skin tone plum goes really well with it, if i wear very little makeup on my eyes, however, if i wear a lot of makeup on my eyes, i wouldn't be able to wear the plum cause that'd just be, like, too much, so i'd have to go with a light color, like guava or strawberry or a rose-y shade (just a few tips). so, anyway, this is fantastic and you should mos def buy it! i'm stuffing my mum's stocking with the 3-pack gift set of pink shades - the one only bad thing about this lip shimmer is that you have to have a mirror to apply it, especially with a dark color cause, if you don't, you could accidentally mess up the application end up looking like a clown because you have to wipe off the outsides of your lips cause the lip shimmer is a lot softer than, let's say, the texture of a regular balm, so you could accidentally apply some right above or right below your lips it would be super noticeable you wouldn't even know it...also, because of this, you can't really rub your lips together, like with regular lip balms it does wear off somewhat quickly but not too quicky, so it's still pretty good quality.",5,1.0

"i tried the champagne shade of this lip shimmer. i loved the way the lip balm feels and moisturizes, but the color is a little too light and shimmery. i think the plain tinted lip balms will be better suited to my needs.",3,1.0
"i must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter. the secret is a little bit of mint that gives chapped lips that cool feeling of being rescued from cold or windy weather in the winter or too much sun in the summer. they come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like champagne, to a fair amount in shades like merlot. the watermelon shade is the one that i like the best because i like the cool pink colors.the ingredients they list are: helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, beeswax, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) wax, lanolin, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil. may contain: iron oxide, mica, carmine, titanium dioxide. the peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized. because there are a lot of oils in it, i find that i have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer so you don't have a build up like you might with regular lipsticks.i've turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as i do.",5,1.0
"i love, love, love the cocoa lip shimmer! please bring it back! i have tried other shades in the lip shimmer, but i don't like them nearly as much. i also have tried other products that are close to the same shade and they don't have the same refreshing feel on my lips. bring cocoa back!",5,1.0

"saw this movie in 3d on my friend's tv and it made me buy a 3d??k it looked so good. the movie is worth a watch but can lose your attention here and there. i wish i would've bought it in 3d. either way, is a new look from the classic.",4,1.0
"i love this stuff! i have the plum shade and honestly it's one of the best lip products i have ever used. it has a lip balm kinda of texture, but it's very dry, but in a good way. the color is very vibrant and beautiful and lasts for hours. it goes on matte, so if you'd like a more glossier look i'd say put this lip shimmer on and then some lip gloss to make it shine, but i love it matte. not only does it looks good, it feels good. it definitely moisturizes your lips with a hint of mint. the slight tingle from the mint reminds me of the mentha lip shine from c.o. bigelow. it has everything i've ever wanted in a lip product all rolled up into one. i definitely recommend this lip shimmer for all lovers of both lipstick and lip balm. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",5,1.0
"dear nexxus: i have used your exxtra gel, superior hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. it is less thick and does not hold as well. i was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. it reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. please bring it back!!!",2,1.0
"this new haircare range is like nothing else i've ever tried out! i was so intrigued by the new clay technology i had to try it out and am so pleased with the results. this is because it leave my roots sumptuously soft and cleansed, and my usually very dry ends feeling very nourished- this is a must for anyone who feels like they have a nasty build up of products on their hair, and is feeling a bit of tlc this review was collected as part of a promotion.",4,1.0

"this use to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner, it made my hair look and feel like i just walked out of the salon. i would get compliments on how great my hair smelled several times a day. people would often ask me what i was wearing that smelled so good and i would always reply with a smile it's my hair. then i purchased this new formula and scent and instantly noticed the difference. my hair was weighted down and looked greasy and there was no beautiful scent. i've switched shampoos since and can't seem to find one that makes my hair look as good or smell as good as this shampoo once did. please bring back the old scent and formula. please!!!!",1,1.0
"hoover out-did itself with this product. wow...i'm impressed and perfectly happy with my purchase. the upright canister is everything and more with suction. pulls itself along on low carpeting and is very lightweight. the tag-along canister vac for the stairs and bare floors is totally awesome...!! with the wand extension, there's no bending over. it glides along the floor and cleans under things just perfectly. with all the tools attached, theres' no stopping. i'm thrilled with my purchase. thank you hoover for making my life easier...!!!",5,1.0

"i purchased this ragu, along with prego, to see if there was much of a difference in taste, and there just was not. the ragu is a little sweeter, but other than a small difference in color, there really was not much of a difference. we take the tomato sauces, and spice them up our own way, and we generally use ragu, and it has always come out very tasty and the right texture, that we love. we usually get the larger bottle of it, as we use it for many things. we like to always have the ragu on hand to make everything from spaghetti, to chili, to anything that needs a tomato sauce.",4,1.0

i recently tried caramel and fig lip shimmer and it is the best lip color ever for me! warm colors work best for me and the caramel color looks great with my skin tone. fig is nice for a berry type color. the lip shimmer moisturizes as well as they say and lasts pretty well for me despite the fact that it is more of a balm than a lipstick. love this stuff!,5,1.0
my all time favorite lip product is the lip shimmer named cocoa....can you imagine my dismay when i tried to buy a new one last week!!! after checking 3 stores i realized that i wasn't going to find any more of my all time favorite shade. so i actually came to the burt's bee website for the first time hoping against hope that i might be able to order my favorite shade but apparently that is not an option....i can't believe that you didn't have a shade even close to cocoa!!!!! please rethink this decision and bring back some of the all time best sellers----there's nothing else for me to buy!!!!! i'll be looking for the return of cocoa..................,5,1.0

"this movie was simply perfect. it follows the godzilla format perfectly while telling a unique and original godzilla story. many staples from the godzilla franchise are all over this movie and plenty of fan service for the old school crowd. the director really captured the heart and soul of the godzilla franchise. i get the idea that a lot of the hate you hear for this movie is coming from people who aren't old school godzilla fans. whether you are a fan of the sh?wa series, heisei series or millennium series there is definitely something in this movie for you. i cant say too much more without spoilers.on the other hand if you have never seen a classic japanese godzilla movie then this likely isn't for you. like it's predecessors the story focuses on the human characters and the philosophical question of how much control does man have over nature. while there are some great monster on monster brawls if you strap yourself in for that reason alone you will be greatly disappointed. the best way to describe godzilla is the love child of an art film and a disaster film. this movie was made for the existing fan base, not for the summer blockbuster crowd.",5,1.0

"was disappointed when tried to purchase the usual exxtra gel and saw they were out. i finally found it but noticed the packaging was different. much to my surprise i found that they had changed the formula. i gave it a try and immediately notice that this was definitely not the same, nor was as good. first was the fragrance, the old had little to no smell to it, but this new one had too strong a smell. i don't want my hair product to have a scent, that is what cologne is for. my wife immediately commented to me that the scent bothered her. the next issue is that the feel, hold and and styling was not as good as before. it make my hair my hair feel soft after, but so did the original. bottom line is i don't think this is as good a product as the original. please bring the original formula back and soon. i loved the old product much better!",1,1.0

"i received this line of products in my lorealhair extraordinaryclay voxbox from influenster free for testing purposes. i love that it addresses the issue of having dry ends but oily roots. i have used it a few times, and i'm not turned off by it at all but i'm also not overly impressed. my hair seemed to still be the same way - dry on the ends and oily at the roots after use. it may take longer to show the results, but i can definitely say it doesn't seem to be a one-use improvement product. also, having color-treated hair, i would have liked to be more assured than a small line that reads suitable for color-treated hair. it doesn't seem to have hurt my colored hair though, so thats great! the smell is awesome and the formula seems gentle. i probably still would rcommend trying this product because it may work better for others and if it does take care of the oily and dry conundrum for someone, that is awesome. props to l'oreal for introducing a product that addresses that issue. contest this review was collected as part of a promotion.",3,1.0

"i loved it. the ease of manipulation during styling, the hold, the texture, the finish... everything you want for a piecey pixie.but it sticks tenaciously to the hair like tree sap or gum. so much so that it is impossible to wash off. for that, this first try might be my last if i can't find a way to still get back my clean hair at the end of the day.",2,1.0

"i've been using this product for about a month, and it does live up to some of its claims. one thing that stands out in particular is the fact that it tamed my grays. it didn't do anything miraculous, like prevent those suckers from growing in the first place, but it did keep the wiry hairs from sticking up like a beacon of my impending old age. another surprising quality was that it detailed my hair nicely. a brush would just glide through, even when wet. finally, as a girl who only washes her hair 2 to 3 times a week, this conditioner kept it from getting too oily too soon. unfortunately it did dry out my scalp, or perhaps that was the shampoo's fault. i would not repurchase this product as it contains too many ingredients that i can't pronounce, however, i will keep what's left in the bottle and use it once a monthwhen my hair needs extra detangling, or when those nasty gray hairs pop up and need a little taming. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",4,1.0

"i usually have dry, cracked, chapped, dull lips and i always tried to to find a good moisturizer to use on my lips to lock in moisture back into my lips and try to brighten them a bit, i could never find a product like that but now i did. i used this literally just found this hours ago in my drawer and decided to use it and now i could seriously feel a big difference. this might sound gross, but my lower lip had a cut and whenever i talked or moved my lips, the cut would open and it hurt bad so after i used the vaseline, my lips don't hurt anymore and i can now move them haha. but seriously, this is a good moisturizer for your lips and tomorrow i am pretty sure i will even see better results, i look forward to trying the rosy one :)",5,1.0
"i love clorox wipes, i have tried others but for me i like that fact that it is not a thin wipe and there is more solution so it doesn't feel as dry. i have tried lysol in the past but you get what you pay for, although their wipes are a few cents cheaper they are thin, they rip and just don't seem as if they are doing the job. i use clorox wipes on everything from, kitchen, bathroom to my computer desk and dining table. i even use them on light switches and door knobs. my husband uses them in the trucks great for spills and just cleaning the interior. good stuff clorox keep up the good work. )",5,1.0

"i am trying to reduce the amount of pesticides herbicides in my diet, so i have been looking for organic products and trying to avoid gmo since they are usually engineered to survive heavy dousing with herbicides (monsatan calls it rndup ready, like it is a good thing). anyway, i enjoy sushi at home and have tried several brands of quality sushi rice in my zojirushi cooker. this rice seemed not quite as flavorful, a little longer grain, and slightly more mushy than a couple of the super-premium (non-organic) brands i have tried. that being said, you can make nigiri rolls with it and it works. it is expensive, but my local wallyworld just started selling lundberg at a lower price than this and i can just get a bag or 2 as i need it. i will use this rice when making rolls with lots of other ingredients and save the super-premium sushi rice for special occasions when making nigiri. if you can get sushi rice from japan (they don't generally allow export of their good rice), get it as it is most likely organic, even if not labeled by our usda. i am rooting for lundberg and other organic/non-gmo producers and will continue to buy their products.",3,1.0

"received this complimentary of influenster for sampling purposes but these opinions are mine. i really liked this 3 part system, including the conditioner. then conditioner smoothed my hair without making it oily and i didn't have to apply any product after showering because my hair is usually dry then. my hair produces oil quickly throughout the day so i was impressed that this system was a pretty good balance between dryness and oiliness. i would purchase again and i'd recommend. without styling, i didn't have to rinse hair for 48 hrs and with styling, my hair lasted about 36 hours. usually by the next day, my hair is already oily as soon as i wake up. this was not the case! thank you!! this review was collected as part of a promotion.",4,1.0

"when i first heard that burton was doing dark shadows i was a bit worried. after all, how could it compete with the original quite well, as it turns out. true, the original concept would have made 'purists' happy, but depp, while acknowledging all the built-in comedy, intentionally (i hope) down-plays the humor, making it work even better. michelle pfeiffer was wonderful as elizabeth collins-stoddard! forceful and pragmatic. and beautiful, of course! helena bonham-carter (my favorite ophelia!) was fantastic as dr julia... even down to some of the mannerisms used in the tv show... i must admit that i thought the 'adjustment to the pedigree' was added a bit too late, but after watching it more-than-once (which is easy to do) it bothers me less each time i watch it. i must acknowledge the cameo of the original barnabas, johnathan frid, at the 'happening'. nice touch! i originally saw it in the theater and vowed that i would own it when it came out on dvd. preordered. done! i cannot think of anything i truly disliked about this movie... nothing at all!",5,1.0

"both machines get the job done well. love that both are bagged. hepa is a plus. i have used bagless for years, and hate the idea of emptying the dirt bin. having to empty the dirt bin into a trash can by tapping it defeats the purpose of vaccumming the dirt. don't you think the upright is light enough, but not as light as oreck. it can goes pretty flat. the cord is really long. the light is very good and helpful. the low setting is already very loud, so i would not go for the high setting. if loud means powerful, then that is what i have to live with. the canister is not cordless, but a plus side is that it will not loose suction because it doesn't depend on the battery level. the cord of the caniter unit is several feet long, so it is long enough to stretch acroos at least half of my living room to get the job done. a bagged canister is hard to find, too. the price is pretty reasonable for a high-end machine. do not know if they will last years. have owned them for several weeks, and used them every 2-3 days. all in all, a happy purchase.",5,1.0

"aside from ""dumb and dumber"", tsam is the only other good ferrelly brothers film. while partly slapstick comedy, its all done in line that makes sense for these characters/world. some may argue that it hasnt aged well, and to some degree that may be true. this film was for every grown up in the 90's, but today it's targeted audience may be a bit more narrow. perhaps the ferrelly brothers didn't lose their touch as maybe everyone just grew up. i loved this movie in it's day. so as to not base on nostalgia, i must assert that this isn't for everyone. the story and events are very continuant. the comedy though, isn't as deep as some folks may like their content to be. if you ever heard about cameron diaz being a dropdead knockout, it was this film (and the mask) that put her on the map.",4,1.0

"i would like to start off my thanking influenster and l'oral for allowing me to try these products at no cost in exchange for an honest review. i also wanted to note that i have blonde, color treated hair. please keep in mind that just because a product does/does not work for me, does not mean it will/will not work for you. different products work very different on different hair/skin types. inside the voxbox was a clay pre-shampoo treatment, a shampoo, and a conditioner. it claims that there are three different types of clays in this system, all which work together to keep your ends hydrated and your roots non-greasy for a minimum of 48 hours. i was super excited to try this and have been trying it for a little over a month now. i am sadto say that this treatment did not work for me. with my normal hair care regime, my hair will stay non-greasy for about two days. if i used the clay system in the morning, my hair would be greasy by either that night, or the next morning. so my hair actually got greasy faster than usual. my hair would also be very very flat and lifeless as soon as it dried. i really really wanted to love this system as i wish i could go longer than my normal two days without washing my hair, but unfortunately, it did not work for me. one thing i did love about the system is that it smelled amazing and the smell would last all day. i am sure this system could work for some hair types, but not mine. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",2,1.0

"i suffer from vitiligo, a condition where the skin becomes depigmented. it especially attacks areas of high pigment like the lips. a few years ago, my lips went white. i was using a commercial lipstick, but was not happy with how it dried my lips, when a friend recommended burt's bees with color. i found my exact shade in papaya and was ecstatic. unfortunately, when i went to buy a new one, all the stores had were light colored shimmers. the darkest i could find was peony, which barely tints my lips, which any lip balm can do. fortunately for me, you still have papaya on this site as a clearance item and i am buying several tubes, but i can't be the only one using your product not purely for cosmetic reasons. the light-colored frosts are not something i've ever liked, and from the other reviews i've seen, i'm not alone in wanting the darker colors back. i'm very happy with your product for how it treats my lips. discontinuing colors is unfortunate. is it so hard to keep a large stock of colors available word is getting out about how good these are compared to lipstick. i know i've been spreading the word.",4,1.0

"after the debacle that was the nyc godzilla movie some years ago, i went in to this expecting about the same. i was pleasantly surprised.the graphics were decent, though on a 4k tv will still look pretty cartoonish. the story wasn't great, but kept your attention. many characters seemed only to be in the movie for emotional control only. that was a little annoying as i didn't go into this for story, but for huge monsters destroying stuff.the movie did a good job with monster mashing. it did not however do justice for cranston. if you want to get this solely because he is in it, don't. if you want it for a good godzilla story, it's ok if you try not to think about it. if you want it to see monsters fighting and leaving a path of destruction, this movie is for you.",3,1.0

"purchased based on good review from consumer reports. overall very pleased with performance of upright vacuum. powerful headlight, full bag indicator, high/low speed, but self-adjusting head digs deep into thick-pile carpeting making vacuuming a real workout. i'm not kidding! i sweat! easier to pull than to push. at least the vacuum automatically turns off if stalled for too long.slightly difficult to lift if vacuuming stairs for example, as handle for second hand is located underneath the bag, rather than on top of it.no ""quick release"" for the cord. so you have to unwrap the cord one loop at a time. cord exits the upright near the top of the handle, but would be better if it came out as high as it could. i'm constantly holding the cord as i vacuum and at least i don't have to reach that far down for it. cord is of a good length. i only have to plug it in twice to clean the entire house.less experience with the canister. noisy, as others have noted, and container for dirt is somewhat small. it's more like a large, plug-in dust buster. but i like the idea of a separate unit. no extra hoses or tools on upright.",4,1.0

"after reviewing dozens of customer reviews, i decided to order this package of hoover platinum vacuum.overall i got an excellent product for my money. not only it is easy to work with, but it is very pleasing to look at. nice design, good colors, long enough cords. now i can say i finally enjoy vacuuming.most importantly i enjoy the result. after using more expensive bag-less vacuums that did a good job cleaning up the floors, area rugs and wall-to-wall carpets, but left behind airborne dust that settle after cleaning, i resolved never to by a bag-less vacuum again.this hoover platinum is really a dream when it comes to lasting dust free results. an other feature worth mentioning that the upright is self-propelled and requires minimum effort to push and pull. now our 2,200 sq.ft. floor space takes one third of the time to clean than with my previous oreck, dyson and other models. it is excellent on pet hair as well. our american bulldog's white hair no longer covers the nooks and crevices, since it is quite easy to reach everywhere with the canister attachments (assuming they will stay on better)i ordered a bunch of bags already, as i never want to be without. my solution for odor coming for the bag (animal hair, dander) to add some organic air-freshener balls to the bag before starting to vacuum.",5,1.0

"i cannot express how much i love this product. i used to be a heavy tanning bed user, but i stopped for my skins sake and have struggled to find a product that gives me a deep natural looking tan. this self tanner is amazing, it gets me darker than using the tanning bed ever did and with no sun damage or worrying about aging! the color is so deep and natural looking that people actually ask me if i've started using the tanning bed again when i use this. it doesn't streak and isn't orange and isn't greasy or sticky. i absolutely adore this self tanner and i always recommend it to my friends.",5,1.0

"i remember the teaser trailer of the bombing run where the marines are diving down into a terrorized metropolis. the darkness, the pov, and then came the size of the monstrosity in the distance responsible for the destruction. i thought ""this is going to rock"".i appreciate this film for the serious tone it took. this is the king of the monsters and should be treated with respect, not campy nonsense. much like man of steel i didn't understand the criticism that many levelled at the movie. i don't mind when people disagree with my opinion but i do ask that they articulate beyond ""that sucked."" the opening to me is amazing. the montage of mythical sea creatures on old world maps and the skeletal bones of prehistoric terrors spliced in with footage of atomic age weapons testing was awesome. further into the story, i liked that the nuclear weapons did not create godzilla but was rather used as a deterrent to kill the beast.when i saw the film in theaters, the moment that godzilla rises out of the water after causing a tsunami on an island, shots are fired into the air to illuminate the threat. within the movie, a hush falls upon the film to a deafening silence and when the audience followed suit in anticipation for what was to come, i knew i was watching something special. it was an epic moment.i have to admit. i'm all about story and characters. however, when godzilla fought one monster, i wanted to see more. at first i was left hoping for more because i wanted to see more of the beasts and more of the titular creature. however, i realize that a movie leaving me wanting more is a good thing.i'll be the first to admit that whereas i liked brian cranston, his marine son and his nurse wife were barely characters with not much to do. i liked ken wantanabe as the scientist. his balance of paleontological curiosity and fear for the discovery of the goliath creature is a welcomed depth.the end movie battle between the creatures with humans caught in the middle at the mercy of these titans is great. certain aspects are a bit clunky, but i do appreciate the serious tone and the fact that this was taken seriously. we get inundated with reboots, but this is the example of when we get talent and money behind it. i do hope the seqeul(s) tighten up the script and invest in your human characters.",4,1.0

"i was skeptical when i took it out of the box. i felt the fire box was a little on the small side, but when damped down it holds a fire quite well. i'm heating 2300 sq. ft. and the far reaches of the home are comfortable. i should note that the house is ""earth insulated"". that is, it is completely under ground save one east facing wall. very little heat generated is lost as is with conventionally constructed homes.my only complaint is that it doesn't draw quite enough air when first building a fire. i remedy this by leaving the door cracked slightly open for a few moments and the damper open until the larger wood is fully involved. the manufacturer says a chimney damper is not required but i installed one anyway. i can shut it down with a full box and wake up to enough coals to get it going again without starting from paper and kindling. the blower is adequate if not impressive. six weeks has saved me about $75 in natural gas, almost 25% of my cost to purchase and install. i should note that i cut my own wood rather than purchase it so my energy savings is probably much more than someone buying their wood.",5,1.0

"i have been a faithful and ecstatic fan of iman for her line of makeup and curtains, however this product was a great disappointment. : ( it was disappointing because it is so easy to carry around its virtually invisible, its the size of a lipstick and its at a great economical price but its so hard to apply, its hard to smooth on evenly over your face and it does not come with an applicator. i guess this product was named iman clay makeup because it literally feels like you are smoothing clay onto your face and that isn't something i was looking forward to.",1,1.0

"hoover has cleaned our family's rugs for 3 generations beginning when grandmother bought her first one in 1921 followed a 1935 model used until her death in 1964.when mother married in 1941, she got the 1921 model which was then replaced in 1961. when i married in 1965, we got the 1935 model which was replaced in 1971. the 1971 model was replaced with the new platinum bagged upright; only because i have a degenerative spine condition and the 1971 convertible was heavy and painful to push!the 1921, 1935, 1961 and now the 1971 are all carefully wrapped and stored in my basement; all in running condition. maybe my 4 year old grandson will need a vacuum in 20 years or so.this platinum bagged upright is powerful, cleans thick oriental rugs, low pile wall to wall carpeting and bare floors with no adjustments, fuss or bother. because we have 7 dachshunds in our home ( 4 are ours and 3 are fosters for a local rescue group) i vacuum daily and this lightweight powerhouse is fantastic.in my opinion, the hoover platinum bagged upright continues hoover's century old heritage of well engineered, simple to use machines designed to do an exceptional job cleaning rugs, carpeting and bare floors with no muss or fuss!no fancy frills or sales gimmicks that break, need replacing or contribute nothing to the basic function of cleaning and grooming rugs and carpets...like some other brands.the platinum bagged upright is just a good, solid, dependable and well built vacuum that will do a great job for many years to come!i gave the canister to my daughter in law as it was too heavy to have it strapped around my neck. i have a 10year old full sized hoover canister that i can set in the middle of a room and not have to move or carry to much. my daughter in law loves the platium canister for cleaning the ceiling fans in their 12 vaulted ceilings! so guess the canister is ok, too.great product....only 1 small drawback. the bags are a bit pricey and neither of the 2 retailers that sell the platinum bagged upright (best buy and walmart) have the bags in stock. but, the platinum collection has its very own customer service phone number for any platinum issues, questions or ordering supplies.. so, not a real problem!",5,1.0

"i am trying the pantene expert pro-v agedefy shampoo, as a bzzagent. i receive the product for free, in exchange for my real and honest review. i have been using the conditioner for only a few days, so will leave another review in a couple of weeks. my first impressions of the product is the packaging is nice, a sleek black bottle and their trademark gold lettering. but, i'm a little disappointed in the size...if it's a great product, i want it to last! after only two washes, i am starting to see that my hair is slightly less tangled when i brush it out, and my grey's seem to be slightly more manageable. can't wait to report back after a couple of weeks of use! the only drawback so far, is that the scent of the shampoo differs slightly from the great scent of the conditioner. wish it was the same (the shampoo smell is fantastic!) thank you pantene expert prov and bzzagent! this review was collected as part of a promotion.",3,1.0

"my daughter and i have been using the clear shampoo and the clear conditioners for about 2 years now. smells great and makes our hair feel soft. however, every few weeks we have had to switch to an alternate shampoo and conditioner for a few days as the clear would make our scalps itchy. we both were seeing a lot of hair in the drain catcher with every shampooing with the clear products but just chalked it up to the fact that we both have longer, wavy hair. about a week and a half ago we decided to try something different that a sales clerk suggested. we have been using paul mitchell lavender and mint shampoo and conditioner and have found we are only losing very few strands of hair with each washing. this leads me to the conclusion that the large amounts of hair in the drain while using the clear was not a normal amount of hair loss! it was caused by the clear. i will not be buying their products again nor do i recommend their products to others.",1,1.0

"i read all the reviews and was hesitant to purchase such an expensive vacuum cleaner but one of the things i needed was something that was good at picking up dog hair on both carpeted and hardwood floors. i decided to try this since it got no bad reviews and wow! i have never ever had a vacuum cleaner that had such suction and power. i was so amazed at how easily it moved due to the ""self-propelled"" mechanism.the only improvement would be to have some attachments on board so when you are vacuuming a room you could quickly do corners, etc., but then it probably would take away from the suction power! the little vacuum is very convenient for little jobs and it will work for when i need the attachments.one thing that i never saw in any of the reviews i read is that the vacuum cleaner bags are self-sealing. that means that when you remove them from the vacuum cleaner, they automatically seal so no dust or particles escape into the air. i always hated that when i had to re-vacuum after removing a bag. the bags are very thick and high quality so it's no wonder they are expensive.if you are debating about this one and you're on the edge, just take the plunge. you won't be disappointed!",5,0.0

"i love salt and vinegar chips, but these lay's salt and vinegar chips are patheticwhat i love about them:inexpensive - compared to other brands of potato chips, these are cheap and are often on saleeasy to find in stores - compared to other brands of potato chips, these are extremely easy to find in stores, and available just about everywheresalty - these chips are very salty and you taste the salt in every bitewhat i don't like about them:too much vinegar - these chips have way too much vinegar and have an unpleasing bitter taste to themsoggy/wet feeling and consistency - these chips have a very soggy and wet consistency to them. they feel filmy, like vinegar film, not like salt film, and have a very soggy overall taste that lessens the crunch. they don't feel wet, but the consistency is wet, very unappetizingnot very crunchy - unlike other brands of salt and vinegar chips, these are not very crispy. they are very thin, slightly thicker than paper, and don't really have much of a crispness to speak ofalways broken chips - every time i've ever purchased this brand of salt and vinegar chips, whether online or in a store, the chips are almost always broken all throughout the bag. the bag is very thin, compared to other brands, and the chips are always brokenat the end of the day, these are terrible salt and vinegar chips and there are so many tastier and crispier varieties out there, that i no longer consider this brand",1,1.0

"first, a disclaimer of sorts ?? i?? a long-term, died-in-the-wool hoover evangelist. no, i don?? work for hoover, but i??e used hoovers religiously for 30 years. i??e tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but always returned to hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability.that does not, however, mean they were perfect.??the hoover windtunnel u6439 bagged upright that i??e had for the last several years would suck up a buick. unfortunately, it also rivaled a buick in the weight category. although it?? supposedly a ??elf-propelled??model, i felt like i had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. it became something i would put off because i wasn?? sure i had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house.??the windtunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them.??the hepa filter on my old windtunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. after that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as i vacuumed, even after i cleaned/replaced the filters.??lastly, noise of my previous windtunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.when i saw a tv commercial for the hoover platinum series machines, i was definitely intrigued. i loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, hoover). but i was skeptical; could the power of a hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds? i?? tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best.i made a beeline for the internet to start researching. over a couple of days of intensive reading, i decided to continue my trust in hoover and took the plunge.both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when i got home from work. the first thing i noticed was that i could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a sumo wrestler??that was promising. after removing everything, i was stunned at the weight ??or lack thereof ??for both machines.the physical appearance is very appealing; the upright is sleek and slim with a 35??long cord, and the canister has tools-on-board, along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can ??ear it??while you vacuum. you will be stunned by how little these machines weigh ??a child could easily lift them both. but could they clean?when i fired up the platinum upright, the word that kept coming out of my mouth was wow. first off, no more jets taking off in my living room ??just a pleasing hum. second, this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term self-propelled. it seemingly floated over my carpeting all on its own, while still having the suck-up-a-buick power i expected from a hoover. it cleaned better in one pass than its older u6439 windtunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. i was picking up stuff i didn?? even know was there. whether vacuuming underneath your bed, or behind that dresser that you haven?? moved since you moved in 15 years ago, it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.i have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that i had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks. the platinum upright made it look brand new. and hallelujah for a true edge cleaner! everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights, but this one truly delivers on the promise. think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers ??like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor. this platinum upright sucked up all that debris ??right to the edge.the maneuverability of the platinum upright is astonishing. it truly is as light as hoover claims and it moves as easily as a dyson. the upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease. it also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent, lighted, fingertip control right up there on the handle.the hepa filtration is light-years ahead of my previous windtunnel ??think hepa with a hemi under the hood. yes, i know that bags are expensive, but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk. i don?? mind paying for a product that truly works ??these bags, and this new platinum hepa filtration system, truly work. no dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywhere.the platinum canister has a carrying strap, which makes so much sense. the folks who clean my office building uses strap-on canister vacuums and i always ??hat an intelligent design????now, i??e got my own. and all the tools are right there attached to the unit, ready and waiting for you. i toted that canister all over the house, cleaning window sills, ceiling corners, air conditioning vents, everything! then i walked into the garage and cleaned the inside of my suv. it?? quiet, powerful and incredibly portable ??the best ??anister??i??e ever used.in my first test run of this hoover platinum ??acuum system,??i found myself looking for stuff to clean; i couldn?? get enough of it. the hoover uh30010com platinum is, quite simply, the best vacuum period i??e ever owned. i absolutely love this machine ??and to get 2 vacuums ??an upright and a canister ??for the same price just makes terrific economic sense. it has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet, sleek, lightweight package that doesn?? leave me feeling deaf, sore and exhausted. bravo, hoover!",5,1.0

while this one is way better then the roland emmerich travesty starring matthew broderick it's still not saying much. the reverential approach is right but the script is so boneheaded wrong that's it's almost impossible to stay interested in the first hour. way too much family drama that goes totally nowhere. the second hour brings a little giant monster battle goodness but the movie cuts away from the action way too much.the 3d isn't great. at least not on my epson 5030 projector. tons of ghosting. especially in the dark monster battle scenes. the movie wasn't shot in 3d and the conversion actually gets in the way. get the 2d version instead. on the bright side the soundtrack is amazing. if you have a really good sound system this sucker is gonna knock you off your couch.,3,1.0

"gourmet blend, whole grain brown rice. yummy! a tummy pleaser. my husband loves this rice - a little more than i do. i've made three cups at a time rather than the two-cup recipe so that my husband will have some left over for an evening treat or next day treat. i use tones chicken or beef base along with some orzo and spice classics vegetable flakes, thereby making my own rice-a-roni. my cupboard is full of rice. i also bought the 6-pack of lundberg wild rice and brown rice blend. i'm not worried about expiration dates as long as the rice stays dry. i think we will use up both boxes this year. good stuff.",4,1.0

"most that give negative reviews fail to mention personal hair texture and scalp sensitivity. 1) keratin treatment isn't for everyday usage. if you use it everyday or every other day it may make your hair brittle (which will cause breakage). try to wash and condition your hair no earlier than 6 weeks from initial usages (this goes for any keratin or kertain infused treatment is based off your own hair texture). 2) if you have sensitive scalp consult with a professional, they may recommend a different brand. however, a sensitive scalp may get away with using the conditioner only. keep in mind that a keratin treatment is for straighten and/or loosening curls excessive usage is the same as over processing hair with dye, relaxers, perms, etc. keep another shampoo and conditioner handy for your normal routine.",5,1.0

"i have to admit, i wasn't hopeful for this conditioner. my usual conditioner is thick, globby stuff that kicks some serious butt and in comparison, the head and shoulders one seemed more watery and wimpy. it smelled nice though so i started working it through the ends of my hair. once i washed it out and my hair dried though, it was fabulous. my hair was bouncy, clean, and felt amazingly soft. it's definitely much better than my usual conditioner even though i need to use a bit more of it to work through all the kinks in my hair. the bottle said that it locked in dandruff fighting power. however, dandruff usually isn't a problem in the ends of my hair, it's usually a problem at the scalp. and while i currently don't have dandruff, i also rarely put conditioner on my scalp as it usually makes my hair feel oilier. i don't know how it would lock in the dandruff fighting power if it never actually reaches my scalp. but, overall, my hair was shinier and softer when using this conditioner and the shampoo than with my usually routine so i love it. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",4,1.0

"i purchased this product based on two things. i wanted to get away from bagless and i wanted to buy a quality vac. i was so tired of vaccuming up a huge pile of junk and then having to empty it out and then clean out the filter. i think all the dirt that i had just sucked up went right back into the air and into my house! i know that bags cost money but it does not compare to the frustration i feel when i am emptying a bagless. there weren't that many bagged vaccums to choose from in the stores but i am positive that i made the right choice. the hoover did cost more than i had planned to spend but, i got the quality i hoped for. my carpets looked fantastic after just one cleaning! the sleek old-school style and windtunnel purring of the motor was another plus. you get what you pay for, right.",4,1.0

"having only used 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner products from head and shoulders i was expecting a little more out the their standalone conditioner. after shampooing with with a dandruff shampoo it's vital to have a good conditioner to keep my hair from drying out. although it kept my hair from the dry/rough feel the 2in1's gave me, in the end it didn't accomplish the soft hair feel i was hoping for. also, like the classic clean shampoo, the smell was unpleasant to me. all in all its a decent conditioner if you're looking for the bare minimum conditioning capabilities. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",3,1.0

"i've used this vacuum for the last month and it has been great. i'm used to bagless vacuums so having the bag is a nice treat - since i don't have to see the dirt all over again. it is a one pass vacuum and goes from carpets to bare floors without having to press any switches. the on/off switch is in a great location and the one 'switch' it has it to switch from low to high suction. i've never used the low function and i'm not really sure why it's there.the separate canister is pretty good. it doesn't have as much suction as the upright but it gets the job done. being able to put it on your shoulder and walk around the house (with the extra long cord) has been great. i do have two issues with this though; first, i miss having the ability to use the attachments during the course of my vacuuming as it is a whole separate appliance. with this, i'm less likely to do a complete job because once i'm done with vacuuming, i just want to be done. second, the storage of it is awkward. it doesn't fit within itself at all.",4,1.0

"i've owned this hoover for almost three months and use it every few days. it looks great. set up was easy. the upright is very light. love that. i can vacuum the whole house and not feel tired. it cleans quite well on carpet, but fairly well on hardwood. it picks up most stuff on hardwood, but it does tend to send some hard dirt flying across the room (and that is on the low setting). it is quite noisy, but i dont mind that too much. the bags are pretty big. i still have not had to replace the one i got with the hoover. but the bags are difficult to find and quite expensive. i tried to buy from the hoover website but they were always out of stock. i dont understand how the manufacturers can be out of stock for months. the canister has very good suction. noisy but thats ok. it is a little awkward to use, and to store. you have to wind the cord around the canister and just let the hose lie next to it. no place to put the attachments, so you have to store that separately, which is annoying bcoz you have to go and get it every time you want to change attachments. but basically, both the upright and canister are good vacuums.",4,1.0

"this chair was super easy to put together. one hole in the armrest was not properly drilled - the top of the hole was filled in but it was easy enough for the screw to go through since the hole was drilled underneath. the pockets are nice - shallow and easy to reach into while feeding the baby - perfect for stashing the tv remote or possibly a small water bottle. the chair is very firm. i have an eggcrate cushion on it - this makes me sit too high to rest my head on the back (i'm 5'7), but without it i think you could comfortably lie your head back to take a nap or something. i use this primarily to breastfeed - my boppy pillow fits nicely on my lap and between/on the arms of the chair and the rocking ottoman is very nice to put my feet up to adjust the height of the boppy. i have heard the occasional squeak (2x in the 2 weeks i've been using it) from under the chair - if i alter my rocking speed for a minute it goes away, so has not become an issue yet. if it does, i'll repost as to whether it was able to be fixed. i have been spending 3-4+ hours/day in this chair and am very happy with it.",4,1.0

"for years i suffered with exceedingly dry hands, particularly in the winter, but most bothersome was the fact that my nails were soft, splitting/peeling - they just would not grow. everyone was telling me to go the acrylic nail route but i did not want to go down that road and be a slave to that process, much less the money it would cost. i began using this product about 2 years ago and within about 6 months my nails were definitely harder and no longer splitting - and my hands were no longer chapped with those bothersome little cuts at the juncture of my fingers/nail tips and absolutely not as dry and hurtful. i found that it was important to use it at least every night before going to bed and to work the lotion into my nail beds (no gloves are needed as it is readily absorbed). it really has worked for me and i've told all my friends about it to help them as well. be patient if you're considering using it to strengthen your nails - it will work, believe me, but it does take time. good luck!",5,1.0
"i used to love clear. i have very oily hair and it used to help controlling it. when i went to my local big box and saw that they changed bottle and read that it was a new scent i thought i should buy a smaller bottle to see if i like the scent first. good thing i did! the smell is totally different, it doesn't control my oil anymore and it doesn't give me the body like it used to. i told everyone about clear when i first used it and liked it. now, i am not so confident about recommending it. please bring back the old formula and scent! i really don't like this new one.",1,1.0

"i love sci-fi  and this show caught my attention. i would compare this show to be similar to lost (which i also love), and lord of the fries. the characters are believable, even the ""bad guys""  the desperation and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive made that show more exciting. there are times that i actually had to pause to gather my nerve before i continued watching. the plot twists, here and there, made it more exciting. i know this is a tv show and not real life, i do feel sorry for the characters that they have to fend for themselves. i watched the original on netflix, and now i have the opportunity to get a blu-ray copy. (i did buy the dvd version of this, but i believe the compression rate was set too high, and there were parts that were pixelated.) i am hoping for the second season to go on sale, and i will buy that, too. if a sci-fi show with younger characters is for you, you will not be disappointed.",5,1.0

"i am very fair and burn easily in the sun. i was excited to try this product after reading some reviews. i have tried this lotion several times, thinking i was applying it wrong or something. everytime i use it, it leaves blotches, especially on my arms and chest no matter how much i tried to rub it in evenly. it also took too long to completely dry. if it is not completely dry, you will have lighter spots where your clothes rub your skin or where your arms bend and such. i just cannot stand still for 30 minutes to an hour for the lotion to dry, not touching anything! the color looked pretty orange. it also had a very bad smell after it was left on for a few hours. also, it washes right off in the shower so don't even think about taking a bath with this because you will be bathing in orange water. the only thing i do like about the lotion is that it gives you color right away and becomes darker over time, but it'd be better if the color wasn't orange. i absolutely hate this product and i do not recommend it to anyone, especially fair skinned people.",1,1.0

(i did buy the dvd version of this, but i believe the compression rate was set too high, and there were parts that were pixelated.) i am hoping for the second season to go on sale, and i will buy that, too. if a sci-fi show with younger characters is for you, you will not be disappointed.",5,1.0

"i have been using the age defy conditioner for a week now and my hair has never felt so soft and manageable. i was skeptical at first about using this new conditioner as my hair is thick and curly and hard to manage. after a week of using this product i am now a pantenr age defy fan! my hair has more bounce and shine than it has in years. i tend to have doing my hair as it looks flat and frizzy or like a poodle getting blow dried. but after using the conditoner my hair feels and looks great. now i love doing my hair and showing it off!! it's shiny, bouncy and makes me feel like a teenager again. this review was collected as part of a promotion.",5,1.0

"fat or no-fat, it's difficult to find anything bad about eagle brand! this purchase is an excellent bargain as it almost always is pricier in stores (more so than the regular eagle brand). especially in the summer we love homemade shakes made with eagle brand fat-free sweetened condensed milk, fat-free evaported milk, fruit, ice and sweet 'n' low, so we use a lot of it. it makes wonderful lemon icebox pies without worrying about all those fat calories in the filling, makes a great hot fudge sauce and many other items. it lacks a bit of the fullness of the regular eagle brand if tasted directly from the can, but when used in recipes it's almost impossible to tell the difference.",5,1.0

"this movie was simply perfect. it follows the godzilla format perfectly while telling a unique and original godzilla story. many staples from the godzilla franchise are all over this movie and plenty of fan service for the old school crowd. the director really captured the heart and soul of the godzilla franchise. i get the idea that a lot of the hate you hear for this movie is coming from people who aren't old school godzilla fans. whether you are a fan of the shwa series, heisei series or millennium series there is definitely something in this movie for you. i cant say too much more without spoilers.on the other hand if you have never seen a classic japanese godzilla movie then this likely isn't for you. like it's predecessors the story focuses on the human characters and the philosophical question of how much control does man have over nature. while there are some great monster on monster brawls if you strap yourself in for that reason alone you will be greatly disappointed. the best way to describe godzilla is the love child of an art film and a disaster film. this movie was made for the existing fan base, not for the summer blockbuster crowd.",5,1.0

"not a fan of the new formula, and particularly despise the new scent. this was the only shampoo conditioner i purchased for the past 4 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't changed it. i never write reviews but felt compelled to in hopes they would bring back the original. until that happens, i'm forced to shop for a different brand because formula aside, i honestly can't stand the scent of the new shampoo conditioner.",1,1.0

i purchased this stove a month ago we are having the worst winter in southern ohio in over 25 yrs was 3 degrees last night it kept my home at 74 degrees my furnace come on this am only once after getting the stove up going again it has not come on since!! my home is around a thousand square ft in size a sectional home sits in the corner of my living room is a nice piece of american workmanship!!!! i cant get 8 hrs of burn time tho as stated but other than that i'm very pleased with it so far would tell others to buy one. i purchased the small model returned it due to issues with draft problems was very hard to keep going if you don't have all seasoned wood as i don't!! this stove is a lot easier to start does not kill the fire when you close the door as the smaller model did!!! you will save on wood due to how long it does burn on a load of wood in the fire box!! do not block the air injection tube on the bottom middle front of stove cause it does burn a lot better if you don't!!! as stated in manual i think if i had all seasoned wood small stove would of worked a lot better! but i do feel there is a draft issue with it should be looked into fixed!!! buy the medium or large cause it does work very well i am very happy so far with it!! :),4,1.0
